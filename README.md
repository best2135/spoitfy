# **Spotify Artist and Album Info CLI**

A simple command-line interface (CLI) tool to quickly fetch an artist's top 10 tracks and the full tracklist of a specified album using the Spotify Web API.

## **üéµ Features**

* **Artist Top Tracks:** Enter any artist's name to get a list of their top 10 most popular songs in the US.  
* **Album Tracklist:** Provide an album name to retrieve its complete tracklist.  
* **Secure:** Uses a .env file to keep your Spotify API credentials safe and out of the main script.  
* **Robust:** Includes error handling for cases where an artist or album cannot be found.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation**

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### **1\. Prerequisites**

* Python 3.6+  
* A Spotify Developer account to get API credentials. You can create one [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

### **2\. Clone the Repository**

First, clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.

git clone \<your-repository-url\>  
cd \<your-repository-directory\>

### **3\. Create a Virtual Environment**

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

\# Create the virtual environment  
python \-m venv venv

\# Activate it (Git Bash on Windows)  
source venv/bin/activate

\# Or activate it (PowerShell on Windows)  
\# .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1

### **4\. Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python packages using the provided requirements.txt file.

pip install \-r requirements.txt

### **5\. Set Up Environment Variables**

This is the most important step for connecting to the Spotify API.

1. Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project.  
2. Open your Spotify Developer Dashboard, go to your application, and find your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.  
3. Add your credentials to the .env file like this:

CLIENT\_ID=Your\_Spotify\_Client\_Id\_Goes\_Here  
CLIENT\_SECRET=Your\_Spotify\_Client\_Secret\_Goes\_Here

## **‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use**

Once the setup is complete, you can run the application from your terminal.

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.  
2. Run the script:

python spotify\_api\_call\_app.py

3. The script will then prompt you to enter an artist's name and an album name.

### **Example Session**

$ python spotify\_api\_call\_app.py  
enter artist name: Tame Impala
